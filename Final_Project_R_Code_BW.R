# Interpretation results

# Household Income did not significantly predict well-being (B = 4.89e^-7, SE = .001, SB = 5.30e^-6, p = .99),

# Age significantly and positively predicted well-being (B = .001, SE = .001, SB = .055, p = .0000023),

# Women (2) significantly reported lower levels of well-being than men (1) with (B = -.014, SE = .006, SB = -.052, p = .022),

# Physical health significantly and positively predicted well-being (B = .009, SE = .004, SB = .035, p = .012),

# Mental health significantly and positively predicted well-being (B = .081, SE = .003, SB = .341, p < .0000001),

# Together, household income, age, sex, physical health, and mental health 
# explained a *moderate* proportion of the variance in hyperactivity (*(F(5, 7144) = 202.88, p < .0000001, R2 = .12)*).

# This means that:

# Income has no effect on well-being.
# When age gets higher, well-being increases.
# Females experience lower levels of well-being than males.
# When physical health increases, well-being also increases.
# When mental health increases, well-being also increases.
